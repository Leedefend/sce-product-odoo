# History Continuity Server Replay Runbook v1

Status: READY

## Goal

Use the same one-click history continuity contract on a server database without
introducing any server-only replay script.

For a brand-new production database, the goal is historical fact continuity:

- old-system facts must be visible and traceable in the new system
- old-system gaps are allowed when they are true historical facts
- new-system rules apply to new actions after go-live
- historical gaps must not globally block unrelated new business actions

## Preconditions

- target branch is already deployed
- target DB already exists
- target production DB is brand-new when using the production initialization path
- migration assets are present in the deployed repo
- frozen replay payloads from `artifacts/migration` are present in the deployed
  repo or extracted release package
- platform baseline initialization has not been bypassed

Production servers do not require the old legacy database. The production
entry defaults to `HISTORY_CONTINUITY_USE_PACKAGED_PAYLOADS=1`, skips all
`*_adapter` steps, and replays from the packaged `artifacts/migration` payloads.
Only set `HISTORY_CONTINUITY_USE_PACKAGED_PAYLOADS=0` in a controlled
non-production environment that intentionally regenerates payloads from the old
database.

## One-Click Commands

Rehearse first:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> make history.continuity.rehearse
```

Post-replay user-surface probe:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> make history.business.usable.probe
```

If the configured artifact root is not writable from Odoo shell, the probe will
fall back to:

```bash
/tmp/history_continuity/<db>/adhoc
```

Replay in non-production rehearsal environments runs in two phases:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> make history.continuity.replay
DB_NAME=<target_db> make history.business.usable.init
```

For a fresh production database, use the auditable production entry:

```bash
ENV=prod ENV_FILE=.env.prod DB_NAME=<target_db> PROD_DANGER=1 \
  RUN_ID=prod_history_init_$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S) \
  BASE_URL=https://<production-host> FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://<production-host> \
  make history.production.fresh_init
```

This production entry runs:

1. start the compose stack
2. install the production module set with `--without-demo=all`
3. apply extension module registry
4. restart Odoo
5. platform initialization preflight
6. phase 1 history continuity data replay from packaged payloads
7. phase 2 user-usable initialization
8. full business smoke
9. role matrix smoke
10. frontend smoke

If modules have already been installed by an external release job, set:

```bash
HISTORY_PRODUCTION_INSTALL_MODULES=0
```

The default replay chain includes historical outflow-request runtime facts:

- `outflow_request_core` runtime headers are materialized
- actual outflow runtime carriers are materialized
- legacy attachments linked to actual outflow are backfilled when anchors exist

The default replay chain also includes historical outflow-request state
recovery:

- `outflow_request_core` rows with workflow audit evidence are promoted
  `draft -> submit`
- `tier.review` remains untouched
- `validation_status` remains untouched

The chain now also includes historical approved-state recovery:

- downstream-approved `outflow_request_core` rows are promoted
  `submit -> approved`
- approval judgment comes from the frozen downstream-fact artifacts
- live approval runtime is still untouched

The chain now also includes historical done-state recovery:

- downstream-paid `outflow_request_core` rows are promoted
  `approved -> done`
- `validation_status` is restored to `validated`
- one minimal `payment.ledger` fact is materialized per recovered request
- settlement runtime is still not reconstructed

Detail fact lanes are included by default because production cutover prioritizes
historical fact continuity over forcing old data to satisfy new workflow rules:

- revenue contract lines
- supplier contract headers
- supplier contract summary lines
- outflow request lines
- actual outflow child lines
- residual actual outflow parent carriers for line facts that strict core rules
  excluded; these carriers are marked as non-ledger/non-settlement history facts

The default replay chain also includes the legacy material catalog archive:

- 2,279,734 old material detail facts are preserved as searchable neutral facts
- 130,624 category facts are preserved from cost categories, global material
  categories, and orphan category keys referenced by details
- no `product.product` records are created from the old catalog

The default replay chain also includes the legacy file index archive:

- 178,931 old file metadata rows are preserved from `BASE_SYSTEM_FILE` and
  `T_BILL_FILE`
- file names, paths, sizes, bill keys, upload users, delete flags, encryption
  flags, and source table identity are retained
- binary file transfer is intentionally not performed by this lane

The default replay chain preserves old user-project scope evidence:

- 20,000 current rows and 70,871 removed/history rows are retained from
  `T_System_UserAndXXGL` and `T_System_UserAndXXGL_History`
- rows are linked to historical users and project anchors when possible
- these records are evidence only and do not grant new-system access

The default replay chain preserves old task/todo evidence:

- 78,822 old `T_BASE_TASKDONE` rows are retained as historical evidence
- executor, read, done, source, business, URL, and timeline fields are retained
- no `mail.activity`, approval, or active workflow todo is created from old rows

If a rehearsal needs to isolate only core headers, set:

```bash
HISTORY_CONTINUITY_INCLUDE_DETAIL_FACTS=0
```

If a limited rehearsal must skip the large material archive, set:

```bash
HISTORY_CONTINUITY_INCLUDE_MATERIAL_CATALOG=0
```

If a limited rehearsal must skip the file index archive, set:

```bash
HISTORY_CONTINUITY_INCLUDE_FILE_INDEX=0
```

The old `HISTORY_CONTINUITY_INCLUDE_BLOCKED_GROUP_B` flag is deprecated for the
production path.

Resume from a failed step in non-production replay:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> HISTORY_CONTINUITY_START_AT=<step_name> make history.continuity.replay
```

Resume from a failed production initialization step:

```bash
ENV=prod ENV_FILE=.env.prod DB_NAME=<target_db> PROD_DANGER=1 \
  RUN_ID=<same_run_id> HISTORY_CONTINUITY_START_AT=<failed_step> \
  make history.production.fresh_init
```

Use an explicit artifact root if needed:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> RUN_ID=<run_id> MIGRATION_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/tmp/history_continuity/<target_db>/<run_id> make history.continuity.replay
```

## Current Included Scope

The one-click path now covers:

- users / partner / project / project-member carrier
- legacy user project scope evidence
- legacy task/todo evidence
- legacy attendance/check-in evidence is privacy-restricted and skipped by
  default; include only with `HISTORY_CONTINUITY_INCLUDE_ATTENDANCE_CHECKIN=1`
- legacy personnel movement evidence is privacy-restricted and skipped by
  default; include only with `HISTORY_CONTINUITY_INCLUDE_PERSONNEL_MOVEMENT=1`
- contract / contract line / supplier contract / supplier contract line
- receipt / outflow request / actual outflow / outflow request line
- receipt invoice line / receipt invoice attachment
- legacy attachment backfill
- legacy receipt income
- legacy expense deposit
- legacy invoice tax
- legacy invoice registration lines from `C_JXXP_ZYFPJJD_CB`; this is a
  neutral historical archive and does not create `account.move` invoices
- legacy deduction/settlement adjustment lines from `T_KK_SJDJB_CB`; this is a
  neutral historical archive and does not update native settlement states
- legacy fund confirmation lines from `ZJGL_SZQR_DKQRB_CB`; this is a neutral
  historical archive and does not update native fund or receipt states
- legacy financing loan
- legacy fund daily snapshot
- legacy material catalog archive
- legacy file index archive
- legacy workflow audit

## Expected Validation

Successful rehearse should produce:

- `FRESH_DB_REPLAY_RUNNER_DRY_RUN = PASS`
- `FRESH_DB_REPLAY_PAYLOAD_PRECHECK = PASS`
- `HISTORY_CONTINUITY_USABILITY_PROBE = PASS`
- `zero_critical_counts = 0`
- `HISTORY_BUSINESS_USABLE_PROBE = PASS`
- `history_business_usable_ready`
- `gap_count = 0`

For production cutover, `history_business_usable_visible_but_promotion_gaps` is
not a default pass condition. It can only be accepted by explicit human waiver
when the remaining gaps are old workflow/todo promotion only
(`mail.activity` / `tier.review`), no user-facing runtime carrier is missing,
and the following smokes pass:

- `scripts/audit/smoke_business_full.sh`
- `scripts/audit/smoke_role_matrix.sh`
- `scripts/diag/fe_smoke.sh`

Business-usable probe decisions:

- `history_business_usable_ready`
  - runtime list/form surfaces exist and actionable todo/approval surfaces are present
- `history_business_usable_visible_but_promotion_gaps`
  - runtime records are visible, but old workflow/todo promotion is incomplete
  - not acceptable for user-facing runtime carrier gaps
- `history_business_usable_runtime_gap`
  - even the core runtime list/form surfaces are not yet present

## Failure Handling

If non-production replay stops:

1. keep the generated `RUN_ID`
2. inspect the artifact directory for the failing step output
3. resume with:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> HISTORY_CONTINUITY_START_AT=<failed_step> RUN_ID=<same_run_id> make history.continuity.replay
```

If production initialization stops, keep the same `RUN_ID` and resume through
the production entry:

```bash
ENV=prod ENV_FILE=.env.prod DB_NAME=<target_db> PROD_DANGER=1 \
  HISTORY_CONTINUITY_START_AT=<failed_step> RUN_ID=<same_run_id> \
  make history.production.fresh_init
```

Do not create ad-hoc server-only importer scripts.

## Operational Rule

The canonical non-production replay entry remains:

```bash
DB_NAME=<target_db> make history.continuity.replay
DB_NAME=<target_db> make history.business.usable.init
```

The canonical production entry is:

```bash
ENV=prod ENV_FILE=.env.prod DB_NAME=<target_db> PROD_DANGER=1 \
  RUN_ID=<run_id> make history.production.fresh_init
```

Any future lane addition must be merged back into:

- `scripts/migration/history_continuity_oneclick.sh`
- `Makefile`
- `docs/migration_alignment/history_continuity_replay_contract_v1.md`

## Production Boundary

Do not copy a simulated-production database into production as the default
cutover method. For a brand-new production DB, run the committed replay chain on
the server so the production database has its own `RUN_ID`, artifacts, logs, and
validation evidence.
