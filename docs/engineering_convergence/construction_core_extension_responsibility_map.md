# Construction Core Extension Responsibility Map

Date: 2026-07-14
Owner: Construction backend owner
Target file: `addons/smart_construction_core/core_extension.py`
Current size: 1,787 lines
Phase: staged responsibility split

## Purpose

`core_extension.py` is the construction-industry extension contribution surface.
It publishes owner-specific facts, policies, maps, runtime builders, and
compatibility hooks into smart_core. It must not become a platform authority for
generic app shell behavior, generic permissions, or persistence rules outside
construction-owned policy.

## Public Entry Points

| Entry point | Responsibility | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `smart_core_finalize_unified_page_contract_v2` | Final projected-contract adjustments for construction-owned forms. | May shape contracts, must not query or persist. |
| `smart_core_normalize_projected_contract_data` | Normalize projected contract data before frontend consumption. | Projection-only. |
| `smart_core_normalize_unified_page_contract_v2` | Normalize unified page contract v2 payloads. | Projection-only. |
| `get_*_contributions` functions | Publish construction-owned policy, capability, route, and model facts. | Must return facts; no hidden side effects. |
| `smart_core_*` hook functions | Backward-compatible hook facade consumed by smart_core. | Keep compatibility wrappers thin. |

## Responsibility Bands

| Band | Current responsibility | Extraction candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import-time registration facts | Construction scope models, reason metadata, governance profiles, action maps. | Dedicated facts modules once import side effects are audited. |
| Project layout projection | Project form node relabeling, user_id pruning, responsibility/collaboration group injection. | `core_extension_project_layout.py`. |
| Contract normalizers | General tax form, enterprise/company form, diary form, workflow contract projection. | Small projection modules by form family. |
| Policy and maps | Role surfaces, nav maps, server actions, file/API allowlists, unlink policies. | Policy map modules with pure accessors. |
| Capability and system-init rows | Home blocks, role entries, task/payment/risk/project action rows. | Fact builder modules by screen family. |
| Compatibility hooks | smart_core hook wrappers. | Keep in `core_extension.py` as facade. |

## Current Guards

## Next Candidate

Next candidates should be read-only first:

- import-time registration facts after module load order and consumers are
  locked by tests;
- relation entry policy after tax quick-create side effects are mapped.
- workflow contract projection after env/service transaction boundaries are
  documented and covered by behavior tests.

Do not move import-time registration side effects until their module load order
and external hook consumers are explicitly locked by tests.
